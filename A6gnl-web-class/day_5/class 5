Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.

<a> <abbr>    <b> <bdo>  <br>
 <label> <map>  
<output> <q>   <select>
<small> <span>  <strong>   <sub>

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!


Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).


<article>   <aside>   <div>   <footer>
<form>  <header>    <nav>   <p>
<pre>   <section>   <table> <ul>




Block-level Elements

> The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

Potential sources for the <article> element:

    Forum post
    Blog post
    News story
    
    
> The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

Tip: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.    
    
    
    
> The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element typically contains:

    authorship information
    copyright information
    contact information
    sitemap
    back to top links
    related documents

You can have several <footer> elements in one document.    
    
    
> The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A <header> element typically contains:

    one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
    logo or icon
    authorship information

Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.    
    

> The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links.

Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.

Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.

> Section
    The <section> tag defines a section in a document.
